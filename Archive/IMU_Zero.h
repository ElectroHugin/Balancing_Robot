// MPU6050 offset-finder, based on Jeff Rowberg's MPU6050_RAW
// 2016-10-19 by Robert R. Fenichel (bob@fenichel.net)

// I2C device class (I2Cdev) demonstration Arduino sketch for MPU6050 class
// 10/7/2011 by Jeff Rowberg <jeff@rowberg.net>
// Updates should (hopefully) always be available at https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib
//
// Changelog:
//      2019-07-11 - added PID offset generation at begninning Generates first offsets 
//                 - in @ 6 seconds and completes with 4 more sets @ 10 seconds
//                 - then continues with origional 2016 calibration code.
//      2016-11-25 - added delays to reduce sampling rate to ~200 Hz
//                   added temporizing printing during long computations
//      2016-10-25 - requires inequality (Low < Target, High > Target) during expansion
//                   dynamic speed change when closing in
//      2016-10-22 - cosmetic changes
//      2016-10-19 - initial release of IMU_Zero
//      2013-05-08 - added multiple output formats
//                 - added seamless Fastwire support
//      2011-10-07 - initial release of MPU6050_RAW

  If an MPU6050 
      * is an ideal member of its tribe, 
      * is properly warmed up, 
      * is at rest in a neutral position, 
      * is in a location where the pull of gravity is exactly 1g, and 
      * has been loaded with the best possible offsets, 
then it will report 0 for all accelerations and displacements, except for 
Z acceleration, for which it will report 16384 (that is, 2^14).  Your device 
probably won't do quite this well, but good offsets will all get the baseline 
outputs close to these target values.

  Put the MPU6050 on a flat and horizontal surface, and leave it operating for 
5-10 minutes so its temperature gets stabilized.

  Run this program.  A "----- done -----" line will indicate that it has done its best.
With the current accuracy-related constants (NFast = 1000, NSlow = 10000), it will take 
a few minutes to get there.

  Along the way, it will generate a dozen or so lines of output, showing that for each 
of the 6 desired offsets, it is 
      * first, trying to find two estimates, one too low and one too high, and
      * then, closing in until the bracket can't be made smaller.

  The line just above the "done" line will look something like
    [567,567] --> [-1,2]  [-2223,-2223] --> [0,1] [1131,1132] --> [16374,16404] [155,156] --> [-1,1]  [-25,-24] --> [0,3] [5,6] --> [0,4]
As will have been shown in interspersed header lines, the six groups making up this
line describe the optimum offsets for the X acceleration, Y acceleration, Z acceleration,
X gyro, Y gyro, and Z gyro, respectively.  In the sample shown just above, the trial showed
that +567 was the best offset for the X acceleration, -2223 was best for Y acceleration, 
and so on.

  The need for the delay between readings (usDelay) was brought to my attention by Nikolaus Doppelhammer.
